Problem Statement-

“Professionals work too hard to build credibility and reputation but we do not have a system where they can store these merit reputations and endorsements built over the years”

Existing networking solutions lack a dedicated platform for professionals to build their credibility and reputation in a secure and transparent manner. This creates a need for a social web3 LinkedIn-like dApp that combines the benefits of blockchain technology with professional networking, offering enhanced privacy, control, and trust. 

Solution - 

A decentralized application (dApp) that combines the features of professional networking and blockchain technology. It provides professionals with a secure and transparent platform to network, build a verifiable reputation.
Professionals need a system to independently showcase their qualifications, experience, genuine

connections, proof of previous work, transparent credential verification order than traditional networking
platforms that lack transparency and trust with limited control over personal data.

Our Product - 

Wagmiclub’ is a decentralized platform for professionals like (creators, designers, advisors, investors, marketers, founders) to network, build reputation and show proof of previous work as Nft badge awarded by organizations,DAOs. This badge is an on-chain
validation which shows an individual is recognized by a company/org. Our vision is to build a future where testimonials, staff

recognition, work reputations hold more validity and become tamper proof on-chain, as they are non
transferable, we are building wagmiclub on Lukso blockchain.
Our dapp provides super user-friendly interface that anyone can easily navigate. Professionals can effortlessly create a profile, network,

earn trustscores, reputation badge and medals.

Recruiters will have the opportunity to explore a diverse pool of professionals through our platform marketplace . We made it easy to identify
top talents by referring to the leaderboard which ranks profiles based on on-chain badge, medals and trustscore.

Use of Base - 

This project utilizes Base as the default wallet provider to streamline the user onboarding process. By using Base Smart Wallet, even users new to blockchain can easily create wallets, enhancing accessibility and reducing the friction typically associated with setting up crypto wallets.

In addition, Basenames are integrated into the project to improve user experience by allowing user information to be retrieved and displayed directly within the app. Basenames can be used in place of traditional blockchain addresses, making it easier for users to interact with the app without needing to understand or manage complex addresses.

This combination of Base Smart Wallet and Basenames aims to create a more intuitive and user-friendly blockchain experience.
